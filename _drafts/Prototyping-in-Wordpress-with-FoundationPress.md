Do a fresh install of wordpress and FoundationPress.

Set up FoundationPress.. follow instructions on its github repo.

Create main pages on wordpress dashboard.

-----

work with header first.. set initial logo and menu items

set up Orbitz (carousel), go to zurb foundation documentation for instructions to implement carousel or any other js component.


-----

Notes:

there are already defined wp functions on templates. its better to start with something thats already been defined and then just clean up along the way.. so atleast we know that such feature exists in wordpress.
