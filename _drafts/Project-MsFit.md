# Intro

I'm starting s blog post about modifying my current vehicle. As of now, my car is about 160k+ mileage. It needs alot of tuning up and exterior paint fixes. But I would also like to add my personal touch while keeping it simple and clean.
Below are tasks which I think it needs working on.

- Clear coat UV damage
- Faded trim fixes
- Scratches and dents fixes
- Engine detailing
- Fluid check and replacement
- Replace sparks plugs and Ignition coil with OEM
- Replace shock absorber with Kyb

Interior add ons

- Power station
- Interior detailing
- Replace broken sun visor clip with OEM
