Lately, I've been delving into ecommerce sites. So I thought, it would be important to research more on different Ecommerce platforms. I've been told as well that it is important to learn how ecommerce system works and what platforms to use in terms of security, how the system is built, and support from the community. A platform I started learning is Magento 2, but tools I would prefer are listed below.

Tools I used to build an Ecommerce site:

- Wordpress
- Divi
- Woocommerce
- Standard paypal

Coming from a Front-End Development background and with amount of code I've written this past years, it was kinda tough for me to grasp concepts on how Magento 2 system works. But this post isn't about Magento 2 but rather digging further into the whole Ecommerce realm.
