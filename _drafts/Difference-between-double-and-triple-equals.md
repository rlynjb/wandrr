JavaScript has two sets of **_Equality operators_** archived under [Comparison operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators):

- equality `==` & inequality `!=`
- strict equality `===` & strict inequality `!==`

We use these operators when comparing 2 operands. They differ on what type of operands are being compared to against.
