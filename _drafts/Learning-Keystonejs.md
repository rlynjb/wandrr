created a docker compose setup for Nodejs + MongoDB with Keystonejs install.

my experience with starting with keystone.js was somewhat a love and hate thing.

coming from a front-end development, i dont know much about database concepts.

keystone.js is a good framework to dabble and start a journey with fullstack development.

- it is also use for large-scale websites.
- it is flexible enough to create custom fields and post type.
- it is still on going development with some aspect of defining fields.
- it is well supported by the community and rarely read negative feedbacks
