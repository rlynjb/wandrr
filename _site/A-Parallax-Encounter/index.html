  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I’ve always wanted to create a one-page website with an awesome Parallax Scrolling. Most of my recent blog posts are about JavaScript, App Development, CMS and rarely touched the topic of graphics and parallax. So for this post, I’ll be blogging my thought-process on exploring Parallax Scrolling.</p>

<p>My initial thoughts when I looked at examples of websites with Parallax Scrolling is <em>‘its not just CSS and JS coding, its also about Graphics as well’</em> and honestly, that first step is what hinders me from building Parallax Scrolling website, not unless I have a Graphic Designer to provide me assets and instructions.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before approaching a project, I usually read a couple of articles first or another approach would be, I start building a project and if I’d get stuck, I then start researching more about it. Since I’ve had experience with website layouts, for this project, the latter approach is what I used.</p>

<p>I then started doing research on Parallax Scrolling and found this article:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.vandelaydesign.com/parallax-scrolling-best-practices-examples-and-tutorials/">The Ultimate Guide to Parallax Scrolling: Best Practices and Tutorials</a></li>
</ul>

<p>From the article above, I will only note applicable concepts that fits to my Parallax website project.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>fallback</strong>: I would suggest developing a fallback method which can work in all browsers even without animation effects. At the very least make sure visitors can still browse the static website.</li>
  <li><strong>simplify</strong>: Parallax scrolling can go from cute and fun to overly-complicated with just a few additions. Make the parallax animation(s) work for your content and not the other way around.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="good-examples-of-parallax-design">Good Examples of Parallax Design</h3>

<p><strong>Generally speaking a great parallax layout should tell a story.</strong><br />
I really like the example on Movement of Data which behaves like a parallax infographic. The site animates both up/down and left/right as you scroll through the content. It’s all very informative and the graphics help to tell the story rather than distract from it. While the effects are not extraordinary they do provide an efficacious storytelling method.</p>

<p>Another great parallax design can be found on BAKE Agency. The homepage animates in a circular fashion rotating through different sections of content. It’s not an exact parallax effect but it does incorporate the illusion of depth as the user moves through a line of sight. The reason I’d mark this as a great example is because it’s usable yet still creative and unique with a stylish implementation.</p>

<p>The goal of a parallax website design is to impress visitors while still maintaining all the customary statues of unofficial UX design law. Great parallax websites convey their message in an easily-consumed format while contributing to the digital art form. Motion is a big part of the design process so it’s important to think about how the page should animate, and if possible have a reason for that choice.</p>

<p>The greatest parallax websites make me feel like I’m interacting with the work of a professional designer. Look through the many examples I’ve provided in this guide and find the sites that make you feel comfortable. These websites can offer the best prototypical solutions for whatever parallax effect you’re trying to create.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="bad-examples-of-parallax-design">Bad Examples of Parallax Design</h3>

<p>My first frustrating example is on Make Your Money Matter which is an informational page about Credit Unions. Let me state that I love their message and graphic design. The page itself is actually very well crafted. However in regards to user experience the page is quite limiting and uncomfortable. You can only scroll with the mousewheel or by clicking &amp; dragging the browser’s scrollbar.</p>

<p>This means the arrow keys don’t work and the page up/down keys also don’t work. To make things more confusing there aren’t any clickable links to slide around the different page sections. The only way to navigate is by tediously scrolling with the scrollbar and perniciously feeding that arthritis. The whole experience feels imprisoning and while the design is fantastic it simply cannot subdue such an annoying UX problem.</p>

<p>A polish website for the children network presents a side-scrolling parallax design with one glaring problem: the whole page is made up of images. Naturally you’ll ask “even the text?”. Yes the text itself, which could have been easily typed into HTML, was instead created with images. I was so terrified at this realization that evening I had to sleep with a nightlight.</p>

<p>The website animation is actually quite nice and even though I’m not able to read anything because Google can’t translate images, I have a feeling this site would be in my great examples list if it weren’t so textually-impaired. When creating parallax designs stay away from Flash animation and be sure to use images only for images. Actually that advice carries over into every type of website, parallax or not. You’ll spare your visitors quite a few sleepless nights questioning their own design ethics and sanity.</p>

<p>To finish up this section let’s go over just one more sample of difficult UX design. The website for South Australian Roadtrips has a quaint parallax slider with a few different pieces of content. While the text isn’t created using images you’ll still have a difficult time selecting or interacting with the text because it appears as part of the slideshow. This means you can’t easily copy/paste locations to search for them in Google.</p>

<p>But really my problem with this layout is that it’s too confusing. There is a top navigation with some buttons that animate between slides but they don’t feel smooth. The animation is slow and it seems like the content would be presented better without animated effects. I’m sure not everyone will agree with me but it brings us back to the concept of simplicity. Make the parallax animation(s) work for your content and not the other way around.</p>
