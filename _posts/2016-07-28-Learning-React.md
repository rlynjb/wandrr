implementing react.js on gulp
- do a gulp task of react.js build

*JSX makes us write HTML syntax in Javascript files

- this does not run in browsers thats why we need a transpiler
- since i am usin gulp, we are going to search for a gulp plugin that transpiles JSX files to plain js files
- JSX to JS using babel

configuring gulp plugin babel was a bit tricky due to NPM dependency issues.

learning react is quite overwhelming. I think with any new front-end is overwhelming due to the amount of dependencies or tools options that are available. Front-end development has indeed bloom.

before digging further into random articles that suggests to use this or that tool. I've decided to learn plain React.js. Stripping other unknown tools and focusing on the foundation, then once comfortable with plain React.js, move on to another tool and implement. Learning indeed can also be a step-by-step process.
