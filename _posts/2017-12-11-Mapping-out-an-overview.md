## My method

- Idea behind the app
- Breaking down the idea
  - Algorithms
    - There are many algorithms thats already been solved, but you can create your own
  - The UX
    - Brainstorm how will the app work. Its user experience mostly. What will the users gain.
    - Tools that can be used are: Notepad & Pen!, [Draw.io](http://draw.io)
- Coding
  - Topics I've learned when coding are:
    - using ES6 map/filter
    - Lodash
    - Mapping arrays
    - Error hadnling
      - Bailout error handling
    - Arrow functions and scoping
      - avoid using `const $this = this`
      - arrow functions already takes in the scope of its parent scope/function
    - When coding, consider readability
- Consuming API
  - Promises, Async
    - learned how to implement Services and how we should separate api calls.
    - Use Vuex to share states, actions, mutations, and other global helpers
    - learened the difference between Promise and Async
  - Proper way to read and use API
    - Use or learn Hypermedia API
      - My interpretation for this is more like **self-documenting** api
    - [On choosing a hypermedia format](https://sookocheff.com/post/api/on-choosing-a-hypermedia-format)
    - [Building an api for longevity spec driven development](https://www.nginx.com/blog/building-api-for-longevity-spec-driven-development)
    - [What is HATEOUS](https://www.recaffeinate.com/post/what-is-hateous)
  - This is actually my first time realizing what Hypermedia are and its purpose, but I still have a few questions about it.
    - We will heavily rely on its API
    = What if we want to change APIs? or its contents
    - Still learning about API comsumptions
