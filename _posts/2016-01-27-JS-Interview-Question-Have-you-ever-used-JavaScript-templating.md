### Have you ever used JavaScript templating? If so, what libraries have you used?

Yes, I have used a JavaScript templating engines.

Libraries I first used was Handlebars.js because it was a dependency for previous Ember.js versions.

But then, our team decided to replace Handlebars.js with Emblem since the syntax on Emblem is much cleaner. It resembles to coding with Ruby.

When Ember.js started to release updates on their core versions, we then started to use what the recent Ember.js provides as it is no more a dependency rather is part of the Ember.js core. Their template engine is HTMLBars
