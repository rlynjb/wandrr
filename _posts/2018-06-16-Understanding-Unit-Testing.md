# Using Mocha webpack

I am using Mocha, Chai with Webpack. There is a npm module to easily integrate Mocha with Webpack.
ref: [Mocha Webpack Doc](zinserjam.github.io/mocha-webpack)

We can also integrate Vue-Test-Utils with mocha webpack. Vue-test-util is an npm module that aids unit testing Vue Components with Mocha.
ref: [Vue Test Utils Doc](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/en/guides/testing-SFCs-with-mocha-webpack)
* Note: is `mocha-webpack` command doesnt work. We can explicitly run node path to mocha-webpack by running `node ./node_modules/mocha-webpack/bin/mocha-webpack --version`.

Below are links for writing unit testing:

- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org)
- [Sinon.js](https://sinonjs.org)
- [Chaijs](http://www.chaijs.com/)

To understand Uniting Testing with Mock, Stubs, Spies, and  Test Doubles. Refer to link below:

After understanding the basis or foundation of Unit Testing. Understand the reasons why Unit Testing is an important tool to become a better developer.
