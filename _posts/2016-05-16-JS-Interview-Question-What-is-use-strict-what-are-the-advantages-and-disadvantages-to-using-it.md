`"use strict;"` is applied to an entire script file or to individual functions by implementing at the beginning of a file or at the beginning of _inside a function_ before anything else.

Main purpose of using **strict mode** is to be able to evaluate your JavaScript code and throw more errors in an effort to make your code more robust, readable, accurate and fixes compatibility issues that may arise for future JavaScript releases.
