When I first heard about Smartwatches, first thing came into my mind was Mr. Inspectors Gadgets’ watch. ehe.. Are these watches going to have its own OS? Later found out that these Smart watches are just companion to you phone. I don’t wanna spend 200+ on these just to receive notifications on my wrist and battery life only last hours. Since it was Black Friday, these Pebble Time watches are on sale and so I got one.

### Why I chose Pebble Time over other smartwatches?

- Battery life. 7 days compare to hours or 1 day from other smartwatches.
- Developer friendly https://developer.getpebble.com/
- Screen is always on. Just shake your wrist to lit up screen.
- Those are 3 major features but you can check out more [here](https://www.pebble.com/buy-pebble-time-smartwatch)

-----

### My first impression

- Strap is hella soft.
- When charged, I first turned it on and it took me to steps/instructions.
- Set this and that, Notifications, install this app on phone, etc, but what I’m really after is to replace my current FitBit activity tracker and so I enabled Misfits. This is the default Activity Tracker App that Pebble Time recommend.
- Screen is always on, yey
- When I left my cubicle (left my phone on desk), I’d get notifications even when I’m in the bathroom. lol

### The next day, I took its activity tracker for a test.

I noticed how sensitive its sensor is. Every swing of my arm, even when I was sitting down, driving, it takes it into account. Coming from a Fitbit and Nike Fuel band user, this was really unusual (but I can see its benefits, I’ll explain later). When I got to my work office, I’ve compared my steps from my Fitbit to PebbleTime. PebbleTime was 50% more than my Fitbit steps count. To be specific, as much as I can remember,

> Pebble Time (Misfits) — 990 Steps | FitBit Flex — 560 Steps

### How is this going to work for me?

Obviously, this isn’t going to work for me, but I want to coz its Pebble Time :-D (to me this is more than an activity tracker, i’ll explain later). And so, I turned to Google and wondered if other Pebble Time users are having the same issue, it turns out, they are.

I’ve also found out that there are certain Pebble Time activity tracker apps you can adjust its sensitivity level. With this information, I thought of how Pebble Time receives data and how it relates to these apps. But anyways, PlexFit is another Pebble Time app that can replace Misfit and be configured to work like Fitbit. Below is another blogger that did a review on Pebble Time activity tracker using PlexFit.
[Let Your Pebble Time Act as a Fitness Tracker – with PlexFit](http://www.pebblestuff.io/pebbletimewithmichael/let-your-pebble-time-act-as-a-fitness-tracker-with-plexfit/)

In my opinion, it seems like the steps we see on the screen is calculated from an app and Pebble Time activity tracker sensor just gathers data. Basically, different apps has its own algorithm that defines our “Steps”. This is kind of awesome in a way we can also configure the sensitivity setting to track, not just Steps, but Workouts. Example, lifting dumbbells, sit ups, and other body movements when at gym. :-p

### Enough geeking out, lets try Pebble Time with PlexFit app

This morning, I’ve installed PlexFit on my Pebble Time in replace of Misfit. I’ve also used the settings from the blog above.

> Algorithm: Rhythm, Step Threshold: 5, Sensitivity Level: -4, Low-Pass Filter: Off

So far, comparing to my FitBit Steps account, it is 50% below with the settings above. It’s 8:25am and these are my steps.

> Pebble Time (PlexFit)— 98 Steps | Fitbit Flex — 231 Steps

### This is so confusing, which is accurate now?

From personal experience, I’d say Fitbit Flex seem more accurate than PlexFit. I’ve grown accustom to using Fitbit Flex, I’ve also used Nike Fuel band, and the Step counts on both bands seem pretty close.

Another scenario to backup my opinion was, I drove a a gas station, took a look at my Pebble Time and had 65 Steps count. Went inside a gas station for some refreshment and got back to my car, looked at my Pebble Time again and steps increased to 71 Steps. There is no way I took only 6 Steps in a span of about 1,200 sq ft building and include the parking lot.

So for now, I am still messing around with its settings. I’ll continue blogging which settings resembles Fitbit tracker.

### Update:

I have been using my Pebble Time watch for over a month now. After weeks of tweaking PlexFit’s sensor sensitivity settings. I have come to the closest configuration below:

> Algorithm: Rhythm | Step Threshold: 3 | Sensitivity Level: -1 | Low-Pass Filter: Off (Default)

My experience with configuration above, starting in morning throughout 6pm after work (8 hours), Fitbit Flex Step and PlexFit Step counts are about the same except it is off by about 10 or 20 steps, which is fine, I am not expecting it to be really identical.

When I start working out at gym (treadmill), that’s when I noticed the the big difference. An hour of jogging/speed walking on treadmill will complete your daily 10,000 steps goal on Fitbit Flex while PlexFit will only account half of your daily 10,000 steps goal.

> Fitbit Flex steps: 10,110 | Pebble Time Plexfit steps: 6,320
