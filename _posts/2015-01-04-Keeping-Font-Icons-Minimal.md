Today at work, I’ve found another new tool that takes fontelloing to the next level. lol.. I was assigned to change Font Awesome fonts to http://fontello.com fonts on the entire site. So, I individually searched for the font icons used on the site on Fontello.com. Unfortunately, some icons from Font Awesome aren’t updated on Fontello so I took advantage of the Custom Fo nt sections that Fontello have.

I’ve googled free font icons svg and came across http://flaticon.com.

http://flaticon.com works pretty much the same as http://fontello.com except, it doesn’t have a config file where we load the fonts we previously chose.

This is where I got the idea of using FlatIcon as a source for unavailable fonts at Fontello and instead, use Fontello as a tool to manage my font icons!
