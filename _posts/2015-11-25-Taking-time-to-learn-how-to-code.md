Hi all, its been awhile since I last blog or tweeted something about Ember.js. I took a break from an Ember.js job due to the amount of concepts I have to learn plus, it was also my first exposure to these front-end technology.
I took an easy web development job utilizing Wordpress (while developing my self-management skills), but lately though I have been actively participating on this opensource online code camp called FreeCodeCamp. So far, I’m really glad I have come across this website. It has taught me important coding concepts not to which I can only apply to Javascript but other languages as well.

Their map consists of a path for learning fundamentals of front-end development http://www.freecodecamp.com/map but it does lack information which is what I expected. As a developer, nature of our job is to research about a specific topic googling multiple resources and stick to a reliable and understandable one.
My experience with its map, I had a mental barrier with the first algorithm, eventually I was able to overcome this phase by pair programming with other FreeCodeCampers and forgetting the fact that I can be a perfectionist at times, basically, “stop over-thinking, don’t oversee the end product, and just code it”.

It took me about a month to complete Basic Algorithms. I find myself constantly asking to pair program, researching about a method, and gathering examples. I was solving one algorithm per day. It was slow at first but I just kept going until I’ve reached Basic Front-End Development Projects.
I was able to build my Codepen account through Basic Front-End Development Projects. I just kept coding and didn’t care how ugly my code looks, as long as I was able to make it work, its fine. I just went with the flow of how my mind was thinking.
After completing my Basic Front-End Projects, again, I took a break for weeks and proceeded with Intermediate Algorithm Scripting and I was surprise how it was easy for me to understand the problem and come up with a solution, but I have to admit, my solutions aren’t efficient though I may still need to go back to some algorithms and projects and refactor my code.

Going through Intermediate Algorithms and Projects, books like “Javascript: The Good Parts” was starting to make sense now. This book has been and will be a useful reference. It brought out coding concepts (as what I’ve mentioned above). From Grammar, Arrays, Regex to Objects, Functions, Inheritance.
Besides learning to code with FreeCodeCamp. I have also taken this time to talk to a few Senior Front-End Developers and get their feedback on what are the important Javascript concepts that are required in order to land a job for this specific company. Glad I took the courage to messaged them to atleast know which direction I am aiming towards.
They were really helpful, was happy to share tips, must-read books and very encouraging to apply for their company in a couple of months and to that I look forward on having an awesome job.
