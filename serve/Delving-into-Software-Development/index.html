  <article class="post-content">
    <p>As far as I can remember, I was 15 yrs old when my interest grew with websites, web designs, graphic designs and the whole multimedia realm, but then, a new desciplne came about, and its Front-End Development. It wasn’t just Macromedia/Adobe Flash anymore, there is much more I can do with Web Design. I wanted to make Designs interact and be functional, and no, I don’t want them to just animate and do simple transitions.
I don’t want Designs to look ‘just pretty’. I want to build useful applications too. I want to architect and design applications.</p>

<p>I admit, I’m lazy. In development, I want simplicity. When I learned Vim, Tmux, and the terminal. They became my main IDE tools, I was set. Development will definitely be simple for me.</p>

<p>When it comes to application development, I wanted to first know how everything connects and thus, learning a <strong>Build Tool</strong> was a start of software development adventure for me.</p>

<h3 id="build-tools">Build Tools</h3>

<p>Build Tools are a way for us developers to take advantage of new technologies especially with JavaScript. I’ve had exprience with Gulp.js, but lately, I am going to be using <strong>Webpack</strong> on my upcoming projects. Not only does build tools let us use latest technology, it also let us define our application structure.</p>

<h3 id="programming-concepts">Programming Concepts</h3>

<p>I know the very basics of programming concepts, basic mathematics, different types of objects, but I learned more when I started reading <strong>JavaScript Interview Questions</strong>. And ofcourse, reading was not enough, I also had to learn how to grasp and interpret each concept. Blogging became pat of my routine. I needed to learn how to explain to my co-workers or other developers what I’m coding.</p>

<p>Reading through different articles about JavaScript concepts, I’ve also come across comments from different developers specializing in low level languages such as Python, Java, etc, comparing JavaScript with such languages. No, I’m not going to the details of it with this blog post.</p>

<p>Getting to know more about JavaScript, I was also able to build a personalization bottlecap opener platform for <a href="https://www.kobalttools.com/personalized-products/personalized-bottle-cap-opener#monogram">Kobalttools.com</a>. Using <strong>jQuery</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, and <strong>Gulpjs</strong>. Application works perfectly fine but, what about maintenance?</p>

<h3 id="javascript-framework">JavaScript Framework</h3>

<p>This has been my frustration but lately, different concepts of what comprises a <strong>Web Component</strong> application has been clicking in. Atleast for me, its pretty tough to learn a framework if you are just doing it alone, but within a team, and with the support of your fellow developers, everything becomes easy. I’ve been using <strong>Vue.js</strong> lately, and I love the framework. If Angularjs, Reactjs, and Backbonejs had a baby, it would <strong>Vue.js</strong> lol. It really is just a matter of practice and being open to learning new concepts.</p>

<p>For now, since it’s only been months of using Vue.js, I try to refrain from using css frameworks/vue.js components. This is so just I will have a better understanding of how to build common UI/UX web components using Vue.js.</p>

<p>Useful vue.js components to get started with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vue.js</li>
  <li>Vuex
    <ul>
      <li>state management</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>vue-router
    <ul>
      <li>self-explanatory</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>vue-resource
    <ul>
      <li>http request component</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>vee-validate
    <ul>
      <li>form validation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>json-server
    <ul>
      <li>a mock-api</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>flexbox
    <ul>
      <li>no more grid system percent base</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>vue-cookie
    <ul>
      <li>using cookie bae authenticatin?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some CSS framework for vue.js:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quasar
    <ul>
      <li>offers Cordova and Electron build. :-)</li>
      <li>offers a variety of components (not recommended if learning vue.js still)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bulma
    <ul>
      <li>just plain ol CSS</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
