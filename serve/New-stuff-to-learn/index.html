  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Before delving into another new things to learn, I wanted to write a recap of what I’ve been doing lately. Can’t really include all details but atleast write a summary of my experience.
You can read further if your interested. I blog to keep track of my learning progress about the web, I consider these as my personal note, but I don’t mind sharing.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="wordpress-and-static-sites">Wordpress and Static Sites</h2>

<p>I’ve worked with alot of wordpress websites as sideline job and with designers and other developers. I noticed that everyone has their opinion about methods of how a work should get done. One important thing is, we should be able to deliver the product. It doesn’t matter how it is built, as long as it works, its good.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>When to code from scratch and when NOT to.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I am a fan of coding things from scratch. I take into consideration how a website/application is built. But coding from scratch is not worth it when its just for sideline.</li>
      <li>Things to note though are:
        <ul>
          <li>Plugins save my projects! lol</li>
          <li>Follow how Wordpress, plugins work rather than customizing a workflow from scrtach.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Learning Woocommerce with a Fancy Product Designer plugin</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Came across a project that requires online sales, so we decided to use Woocommerce.</li>
      <li>Components of a E-commerce website are:
        <ul>
          <li>Products have different variations</li>
          <li>Shipping</li>
          <li>Payment Gateway</li>
          <li>again, Plugins are my hero! rather than delving into APIs</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Static site generator</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Static sites are great alternative to wordpress if a website doesn’t require E-commerce. But it does require learning curve for non-techie users.</li>
      <li>Since static sites are new, it may not be prone to hackers like wordpress</li>
      <li>Example tools are:
        <ul>
          <li>Grav - a PHP site generator, has a really nice optional Admin dashboard.</li>
          <li>Jekyll - love it coz Github uses it, and you can easily publish your site for free. But doesn’t have a nice Admin Dashboard like Grav.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="front-end-tools-and-npm-community">Front-End tools and NPM community</h2>

<p>So I just found out not all developers agree to the whole NPM community trend. IMO though, I love workflows and how easy it is to code with these tools. I love learning at the sametime, so I guess I fit into this type of development preference. </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gulp.js and the whole NPM community.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Gulp.js was the first built tool I learned. IMO, its an important tool so we can use other JavaScript/Front-End tools such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Template engines</li>
          <li>JS transpilers</li>
          <li>JS compilers</li>
          <li>CSS compilers</li>
          <li>workflow automation</li>
          <li>testing</li>
          <li>and more WOWs!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Most tools above are available via NPM modules.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Alternative to Gulp.js, such as webpack, yarn, and bash scripts</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>It seems though built process are always evolving and we constantly have to change tools, thats why I am considering either consolidating my Gulp.js workflow to Webpack or author a simple built script.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="building-my-own-front-end-workflow-theme">Building my own Front-End Workflow Theme</h2>

<p>I kinda figure I needed a codebase to collect solutions to common web problems that a CSS Framework was not able to accomodate. And also, to fit specifications of a project. So I decided to start a theme project called Front-End Flow (FEF) theme.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Delving deeper with Zurb Foundation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Foundation is a great tool to start projects, I built my Gulp.js workflow to accomodate Zurb Foundation and other JavaScript framework/plugins.</li>
      <li>But it still lacks some solutions to common web problems.</li>
      <li>I may need to update FEF repo documentation though to specify these common web problems I’ve come across.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>SASS/CSS part is good but JavaScript part still needs re-coding and cleaning up</strong></li>
  <li><strong>and converting my Gulp.js to Webpack or a bash script.</strong></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="javascript">JavaScript</h2>

<p>These last 2 (JavaScript and FullStack/Ecommerce) are my favorite. This blog contains mostly about JavaScript concepts in theory, but this past year, I was able to put those theories in practice! I’m happy and glad I took the time to read and blog about JavaScript Interview Questions and took courses on FreeCodeCamp solving algorithms. I am 100% sure this is the route I want to go, JavaScript and becoming a Fullstack/Ecommerce developer!</p>

<p>Coding animations or a JavaScript SPA application, either concepts, I know I will take advantage of further practicing my coding skills and understanding of Fullstack concepts.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Demonstrated my JavaScript coding skills, creatively solving problems</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Authored code for a Personalization Platform</li>
      <li>Separated my JS code using ES6 import export feature</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Introduction to React.js</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I wanted to organize my JavaScript code and modularize it.</li>
      <li>Coming up with code snippets to different problems is hard and I think it is worth keeping those code snippets for future use. Thats why I want to take advantage of Web Components and I heard React.js is fully developed for this usage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="fullstackecommerce">Fullstack/Ecommerce</h2>

<p>I was excited when I was able to build a simple contact form, submit it to MySQL database and display it on a Admin page. And also when I first started templating with Blade on Laravel.</p>

<p>Just using a MVC framework makes me think of possibilities I am able to build and how easy it is for me to be able to organize my code file structure and set naming conventions.</p>

<p>I’m starting to think I got this thing for Organization, cleanliness, and performance.
Anyways, below is a recap of what I’ve accomplished and what I want to tackle next:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Basic form submission and query data with PHP and MySQL</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>This is the simple contact form and display of data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Learned Laravel, from templating to submitting form with AJAX</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Learned how to setup Laravel</li>
      <li>Templating in Blade</li>
      <li>Storing and Querying data from JSON files rather than database. For performance purposes.</li>
      <li>Learned how to use AJAX in submitting form in Laravel and storing it in database.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Introduction to CRUD with Laravel</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>After having a glimpse and hands-on experience with Laravel, I was able to get an idea of how CRUD systems are structured in Laravel</li>
      <li>yup! I want to build an Admin Dashboard where users are able to edit data coming from a JSON file.</li>
      <li>kinda like building my own Jekyll or Grav but flexible enough to accomodate database</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Introduction to E-commerce system with plain PHP, Javascript</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I was given a chance to author code for a Personalization platform. I was quite challenged with this project, solving problems creatively.</li>
      <li>I’ve also learned how a JavaScript application is structured with an E-commerce system
        <ul>
          <li>Adding to cart by storing values to PHP Session</li>
          <li>Using Session to keep data throughout Edit page, Add To Cart modal, Cart item page, Checkout page, and last, Order confirmation.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>So there it is, after blogging a recap of what I’ve learned, I should be able to distinguish my next set of concepts/topics to learn and skills to have under my belt.</p>
